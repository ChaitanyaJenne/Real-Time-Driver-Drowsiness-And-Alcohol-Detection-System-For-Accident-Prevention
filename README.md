# Real-Time-Driver-Drowsiness-And-Alcohol-Detection-System-For-Accident-Prevention
This project is a real-time driver safety system that detects drowsiness and alcohol consumption using sensors. If alcohol is detected through a gas sensor or signs of drowsiness like prolonged eye closure or head movement are observed via sensors, it triggers alerts or stops the vehicle to prevent accidents.
